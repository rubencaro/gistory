Install like any regular gedit plugin: just place 'gistory.gedit-plugin' file and 'gistory' folder 
into your ~/.gnome2/gedit/plugins folder.

- You get a tab in the sidebar panel that keeps track of every edit you do on any file.
- If you click on an entry, it takes you to that place.
- If the file was closed, it opens it on a new tab.
- It keeps track of line number updates that may be necessary. 
    Adding or deleting lines before an edit point would change line numbers, messing up any reference to them.
    This plugin will update the line numbers on every entry to point to the actual environment 
    where the original edit was made.
- You can navigate through edit points using the arrow buttons on the tab.
- You can quick navigate through edit points using '<Ctrl>.' and '<Ctrl>,'

Future:
- Allow editing point range threshold adjustment.
- Use glade to design interface, allowing quicker adding of new user controlled features.
